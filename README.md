# Intro

> SQLite is one of the most deployed software in the world. 
> However, from a security  perspective, it has only been examined through the lens of  WebSQL and browser exploitation. 
> We believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
> In our long term research, documented http://research.checkpoint.com/select-code_execution-from-using-sqlite,
> we experimented with the exploitation of memory corruption issues 
> within SQLite without relying on any environment other than the SQL language.

## Query Oriented Programming
QOP is our approach in implementing common pwning primitives using nothing but SQL queries.
We want to share with the community in the hope of encouraging researchers to pursue the endless possibilities of database engines exploitation.
